## Inspiration
Given the circumstances of the world right now, mental health is steadily being ignored. This is especially bad with students. So we developed a relatively inobtrusive way of checking in with yourself and the world while being productive!

## What it does
We developed a Chrome Extension that checks in with you periodically during your work or study session! 

## How we built it
Using resources such as Google Developer, we created the web extension.

## Challenges we ran into
The timer and the check-in implementation were difficult to implement. Since we're not hosting the extension, it took awhile to store data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We've never worked with Chrome Extensions before and it's going pretty well. We're also very happy with the current design.

## What we learned
CSS is a difficult language. You can create a Chrome Extension in 10 minutes.

## What's next for Check-In Chicken
We want to integrate APIs in the next iteration!
